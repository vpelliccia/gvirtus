GVirtuS fill the gap between in-house hosted computing clusters, equipped with custom devices, and pay-for-use high performance virtual clusters deployed  via public or private computing clouds.

GVirtuS test bed allows an instanced virtual machine to access CUDA powered GPGPUs in a transparent way, with an overhead  slightly greater than a real machine/GPGPU setup.

GVirtuS is hypervisor independent,  even it currently virtualizes nVIDIA CUDA based GPUs, it is not limited to a specific brand technology.

The performance of the components of GVirtuS is assessed through a suite of tests in different deployment scenarios, such as providing GPGPU power to cloud computing based HPC clusters and sharing remotely hosted GPGPUs among HPC nodes.

The GVirtuS community is opened to new applications based on the proposed split-driver based framework.
